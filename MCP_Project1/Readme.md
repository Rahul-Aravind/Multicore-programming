1) Description

Implement n-thread mutual exclusion using the following methods: (a) Tournament Algorithm,
(b) Test-And-Set Instruction, and (c) Test-Test-And-Set Instruction. Your program should implement
a class that provides two public functions, namely lock( ) and unlock( ).
Compare the performance of the three implementations as a function of number of threads
(varied from one to the number of logical cores in the machine). Average the results over several
runs. Prepare a report that clearly describes the results of your experiments.

2) Submission Information
You will have to submit your project using eLearning. Submit all the source files necessary to
compile the program and run it. Also, submit a README file that contains instructions to compile
and run your program. Finally, submit a report describing your experimental results with properly
labeled graphs.
